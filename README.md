# Overview

To further my learning as a software engineer I created this simple in-terminal calculater to test my knowledge as a learn the basics of the C++ language.

This project is a simple to use in-terminal calculater that utilizes the advantages of classes to make the software easily upgradable. The calculator is capable of calcuating the four simple math operations as well as saving a calculation history.

# Development Environment

This calculator was programmed using Studio Visual Code using the MSVC compiler.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used C++ with the vector, string, fstream, and math libraries.

Vector Library: Provides dynamic arrays that can resize themselves automatically when elements are added or removed.
String Library: Offers a set of functions for manipulating strings, including operations like concatenation, comparison, and searching.
Fstream Library: Facilitates input and output operations with files, allowing for reading from and writing to files on disk.
Math Library: Contains functions for mathematical operations, such as trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and rounding functions.

# Future Work

- Make multiple operation on a single number possible
- Create a GUI
- Add additional operations
